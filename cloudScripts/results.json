There\u2019s been speculation on the impact of Brexit on London\u2019s prosperity ever since the referendum vote was counted in 2016: for 2021, our rankings show the city at #5 for number of Global Fortune 500 companies (identical to 2020), 29th for GDP Per Capita and 52nd for Unemployment. But our new ranking subcategory, the Gini coefficient (which we refer to as Income Equality), shows the city\u2019s alarming disparity between rich and not: London ranks 149th of 263 cities. Could a Brexit deal be an opportunity to redress? Certainly, some of those who voted to leave are hoping, perhaps vainly, that it could be so. Vainly because in September, JPMorgan Chase & Co. was just the latest multinational to abandon the good ship Britain, moving $230 billion from the UK to Frankfurt amidst Brexit uncertainty. But London is still London and the pandemic has made us value other aspects of city life\u2014critical things, like cool, breathable air, which is made possible by a city\u2019s trees and its green, open landscapes. London ranks #16 for the quality of its outdoor experiences, many of which come in the form of spectacular parks that are the legacy of dozens of former country estates that served as hunting grounds for generations of kings and queens. Today, there\u2019s no better urban experience anywhere, no matter the global forces swirling above the ancient streets. ",

Statewide, more than 18,000 COVID-19 patients were in hospitals at one point in April. Daily deaths peaked at 799 in April, and have totaled over 24,000. A few short months ago, all the data made sense. While New York ranks just 64th for the size of its convention center, the Jacob. K. Javits Center was in the process of being renovated to twice its enormity. Most recently, its square footage had been transformed into a 1,200-bed field hospital, with room, if necessary, for 2,900. A year ago, we went on gaily about how New York was reinventing shopping, with the mall of the future at Hudson Yards and Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus vying for supremacy in the chic city. This year, in the #2 shopping city on the planet (behind only Tokyo), there is no breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s. New York, to the surprise of no one, ranks Top 5 in the world for Global 500 companies (#4). And that is part of the enduring allure of the city\u2014the magical thinking that if you hustle hard enough, anyone could be persuaded to meet with you. New York is, above all, a gathering place where brains and bodies in indecent proximity to one another create the sparks of genius, invention, progress. Today New Yorkers stand at the ready, together and alone, on their stoops and balconies ready to defend their city. From vague federal threats of defunding. From shadowy armies to keep calls for justice and reform loom over the city along with an invisible virus. However the world emerges, evolves or pivots out of our collective force majeure, it will happen here first. New York is, after all, #1\u2014or thereabouts.  ",

But despite multiple terrorist attacks and the destruction of its iconic cathedral\u2014seemingly insurmountable disaster and hardship\u2014Paris prevails and comes back brighter. Amazingly, despite the tragic fire and a year of the Yellow Vest protests that deterred tourists from visiting the city, Paris matched its 2018 in 2019, with 35.4 million visitors, according to Statista. The City of Light ranks #3 in our Product category, with the second-best Airport Connectivity in the world, a #5 ranking for Museums (the city has more than a hundred) and #7 for Attractions. Leading up to the 2024 Summer Olympics, infrastructure investment has sped up and the city continues to build hotels at a dizzying rate. Two dozen opened in 2019 and the same amount were scheduled to debut in 2020, including the first Bulgari Hotel at 30 Avenue George V. There have been plenty of pandemic-related delays. As the saying goes, Paris is always a good idea. And now that swimming in the waters of the Seine is a thing at Bassin de la Villette public pools, even the locals who notoriously leave town in summer are sticking around. City Hall is promising to build five new outdoor swimming pools in time for the Olympics. So even though Paris is now #26 globally for Parks & Outdoors in 2020, it\u2019s a category ranking that should improve.",

Curiosity about Russia has increased as political intrigue has grown, which might explain why Moscow was the 14th-most trending city over the past year, according to our Google Search ranking. The global fascination has as much to do with the spectacular 2018 FIFA World Cup (Moscow\u2019s Luzhniki Stadium in the city\u2019s 360-acre Olympic complex hosted the pivotal final matches) as with the Kremlin\u2019s global ambitions. Accessing all this excitement has never been easier as the curious and opportunistic can fly into Moscow with ease: the city ranks #4 for Airport Connectivity, up one spot over last year. Once you\u2019re on the ground, the recently renovated Moscow subway is increasingly the envy of many Western capitals, as much for its improved efficiency and reach as for its regally art-stuffed stations. Whatever brings you to the city, you\u2019re in for an experience at stark odds with the West\u2019s continuously dismaying news about Russia. Moscow is what Travel + Leisure calls a \u201crevolution of creativity,\u201d giving it an atmosphere of young, free-thinking exuberance that has touched every aspect of city life, from its art and food scenes to quirky, only-in-Russia shared workspaces.

It earned the #1 rank in Shopping for its world-class experiences, like Ginza\u2019s luxury department stores, newly enhanced with the art-bedecked and sharply designed Ginza SIX shopping center. Tokyo boasts the second most restaurants of any city worldwide, and ranks #6 in our Culture subcategory (and #3 overall in our Programming category)\u2014even with the postponement of the 2020 Olympics. The show will go on in 2021, pandemic permitting. Here, the famous pulsating Nightlife (#9) can be experienced any way you like, from the glaring lights of Shibuya to the, well, glaring red lights of Kabukicho. For a more low-key bar scene, Zoetrope in Shinjuku offers an awe-inspiring selection of Japan\u2019s famous whisky. With a #2 global rank for Restaurants, Tokyo is moving far beyond its internationally beloved food traditions. The metropolis offers as many restaurants as the rest of our Top 5 cities combined\u2014more than 100,000 in total, so visitors and residents alike could never hope to experience them all. Iconic spots like Den (among the top restaurants in Asia) abound, while busy depachiku (food halls) can be explored below ground all over the city for a much\u2014much\u2014more affordable price.

These experiences are not by accident: the city reinvented itself yet again throughout the 2010s, growing from a sterile playground for a handful of ultra-rich Emiratis to an international tourism and business destination. That has helped to attract the second-highest proportion of foreign-born citizens of any city worldwide, and they\u2019re a sharp crowd, ranking #16 for Educational Attainment globally. Dubai\u2019s next challenge will be weathering the storm of COVID-19. Even after a first wave that saw 6,021 cases per million residents, Dubai is hoping to bring back the tourists who have become critical to its economy. In 2019, the city welcomed 16.7 million tourists; it will be lucky to see a fraction of that in 2020, despite a worldwide campaign to reassure visitors of its COVID-19 safety. The most visited mall on the planet is here, and helps Dubai climb to #26 in our Shopping subcategory.

The meteoric rise from politically unstable, resource-poor and unskilled ex-colony to talent- and capital-hungry shipping hub (the world\u2019s busiest) and, subsequently, Asia\u2019s wealth management capital is place-brand engineering at its most ambitious. The result is Singapore as a fast-emerging Asian financial superpower whose city leaders take a methodical (yes, many would say \u201cheavy-handed\u201d) approach to urban planning that considers needs that reach far beyond the next election. Singapore\u2019s reinvestment into research, talent and corporate headquarters recruitment ensures it will be home to a sustainably wealthy citizenry for decades to come. It\u2019s why the city-state continues its ascent among the planet\u2019s most prosperous cities, with a growing cluster of Global 500 companies (ranking #30 overall). Today, manifestations of this wealth and confident swagger are everywhere. Only in Singapore does an airport become a must-see attraction, one that receives millions of passengers a year but also lures locals with a bounty of designer shops, gardens, gourmet food and one-of-a-kind sights. Opened in 2019 and designed by Safdie Architects, the new $1.7-billion Jewel Changi Airport features a canopy bridge and glass walkway shrouded in fog and suspended 75 feet in the air. But the real showstopper is the seven-story Rain Vortex, an indoor waterfall (the world\u2019s tallest) that cascades down from a central oculus in the roof.

Until then, we have the city\u2019s music scene thriving, particularly as a younger generation of musicians\u2014Jack White and the Black Keys come to mind\u2014have chosen to live and set up recording studios in town. You can start your visit at the Country Music Hall of Fame, which traces the history of the genre. If you want to delve deeper into the personal stories of Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash and George Jones, well, they\u2019ve got their own museums, too\u2014at least they will when they fully reopen after the pandemic. With a #41 ranking for Culture, the city is finally getting the recognition it deserves for its long but subtle influence on the American fabric. Should you need a respite from culture and the #56-ranked Nightlife, Nashville offers a sprawling park system with more than 12,000 acres to explore by bike (B-Cycle bike-rental stations are located at greenway trailheads), or by kayak and canoe on the Harpeth River. Good thing about all that open space, too, given the high infection rates in the city after some citizens ignored early warnings about the spread of COVID-19.",
